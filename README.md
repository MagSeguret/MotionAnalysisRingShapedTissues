Purpose and scope of this code
-------------------------------
This code allows the contractility analysis of ring-shaped cardiac tissues by the evaluation of the area of the inner circle defined by the tissue in time.

Summary of main files
-------------------------------
MotionAnalysis.m: main code, loads videos, generates figures and creates an Excel file containing the contractility parameters of all the videos and a .mat file of all the videos.
bfmatlab folder: containing the bioformat package, to be added to the Matlab path.

Requirements
-------------------------------
MATLAB
MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox
MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox

Example video
-------------------------------
An example video can be found in the article to test the code before use.
